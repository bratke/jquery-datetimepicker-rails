* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.

* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
